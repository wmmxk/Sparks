It gives the reader a better understanding of some critical [hyperparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) for the tree learning algorithm, using examples to demonstrate how tuning the hyperparameters can improve accuracy.\n\n**Background**: To learn more about Decision Trees, check out the resources at the end of this notebook.  [The visual description of ML and Decision Trees](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) provides nice intuition helpful to understand this notebook, and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) gives lots of details.\n\n**Data**: We use the classic MNIST handwritten digit recognition dataset.  It is from LeCun et al. (1998) and may be found under [\"mnist\" at the LibSVM dataset page](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multiclass.html#mnist).\n\n**Goal**: Our goal for our data is to learn how to recognize digits (0 - 9) from images of handwriting.  However, we will focus on understanding trees, not on this particular learning problem.\n\n**Takeaways**: Decision Trees take several hyperparameters which can affect the accuracy of the learned model.  There is no one \"best\" setting for these for all datasets.  To get the optimal accuracy, we need to tune these hyperparameters based on our data.","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0.0,"submitTime":0.0,"finishTime":0.0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"4180937a-190c-4584-a2ec-09c9c0ae153b"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":503877321549113,"guid":"bac48745-fdff-4f89-85c5-616d1bb6da76","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":2.0,"command":"%md ## Load MNIST training and test datasets\n\nOur datasets are vectors of pixels representing images of handwritten digits.

For efficient distributed training of Decision Trees, Spark and most other libraries discretize (or \"bin\") continuous features (such as pixel values) into a finite number of values.  This is an important step for the distributed implementation, but it introduces a tradeoff: Larger `maxBins` mean your data will be more accurately represented, but it will also mean more communication (and slower training).\n\nThe default value of `maxBins` generally works, but it is interesting to explore on our handwritten digit dataset.  Remember our digit image from above:\n\n![Image of a digit](http://training.databricks.com/databricks_guide/digit.png)\n\nIt is grayscale.  But if we set `maxBins = 2`, then we are effectively making it a black-and-white image, not grayscale.  Will that affect the accuracy of our model?  Let's see!\n\n*Note: The next cell can take about 35 seconds to run since it trains several trees.*","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0.0,"submitTime":0.0,"finishTime":0.0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"713c0cbd-efe4-45d3-8afc-d8290264a2fe"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":503877321549134,"guid":"e5adfb43-904e-4a0e-9a90-e8003ad4416e","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":23.0,"command":"dtc.setMaxDepth(6) // Set maxDepth to a reasonable value.\nval accuracies = Seq(2, 4, 8, 16, 32).map { case maxBins =>\n  // For this value of maxBins, learn a tree.\n  dtc.setMaxBins(maxBins)\n  val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(Array(indexer, dtc))\n  val model = pipeline.fit(training)\n  // Make predictions on test data, and compute accuracy.\n  val predictions = model.transform(test)\n  (maxBins, evaluator.evaluate(predictions))\n}.toDF(\"maxBins\", \"accuracy\")\ndisplay(accuracies)","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0.0,"submitTime":0.0,"finishTime":0.0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"2e16aaba-492d-4581-ad01-f1c457b04e57"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":503877321549135,"guid":"54f16db1-1e93-4a64-8dfb-d3cc7c92301f","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":24.0,"command":"%md We can see that extreme discretization (black and white) hurts accuracy, but only a bit.

(We did it by hand here to show the effects of tuning in detail.)  MLlib provides automated tuning functionality via `CrossValidator`.
